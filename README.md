WhatPanel
=========

Docker based solution for easy web hosting with Ajenti supports FTP/Cron/Sql databases on Ubuntu.

This is basically very simple control panel, if you have docker installed, you can get going with just one command :)

By default has MYSQL/PHP enabled but with Ajenti you can easily install ruby/python/nodejs or any custom softwares.

##The IDEA:

* Easily & Lazily Host websites on multiple small VPS/Clouds instead of one large Dedicated server
* Dont have single point of failure
* Provide as much isolation as you can between clients 
* Allow Web w SSL/Domain aliasing/DNS/Emailing/Database in a single setup 
* Very easy to move around/scale/create dev environments
*
